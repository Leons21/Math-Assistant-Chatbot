[2025-05-28 09:18:30] Bot: Yes, you can find the perimeter of a triangle by adding the lengths of the three sides. For example, if the length of the base is 5 units, the length of the side that is opposite the base is 3 units, and the length of the side that is perpendicular to the base is 1 unit, then the perimeter of the triangle is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 units.
