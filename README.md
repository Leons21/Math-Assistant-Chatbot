# Math Assistant Chatbot
A simple math tutor chatbot using [TinyLLaMA 1.1B Chat](https://huggingface.co/TinyLLaMA/TinyLLaMA-1.1B-Chat-v1.0), built with Hugging Face Transformers.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Chat with an AI-powered math assistant
- 🧠 Quiz mode for basic math practice
- 📝 Saves chat history with timestamp to `chat_history.txt`
- 📦 Lightweight, runs locally using TinyLLaMA model

## 🗒️ Notes
✅ Only evaluates simple math expressions like 3 * 7, 10 + 5, or 2 ^ 3 instantly before using the language model.
- Some functions are not fully optimized and may still cause bugs or unexpected behavior.
- GUI (Graphical User Interface) has not been implemented yet.
- 🛠️ I plan to improve and refine the chatbot, including GUI integration, in the future.
